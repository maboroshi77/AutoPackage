# AutoPackage for SVN 1.0

This program is used for creating a  package (files and folders)  by svn revision ,
unfortunately,there is still have a bug that when you try to run this program（AutoReadPackager.class）,
the svn will force you to fill the username and password twice.

FYA，before you start to run, make sure that your project update and compile completely。
